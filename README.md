# CI/CD description: #

The developer push  for the git repository, github actions doing tests, packs the project and assigns a version, packaging in docker and send notification in slack if the whole process was successful. Argo CD takes and deploys our application in K8s.

Updates follow the same principle.

Argo CD Provides us with the ability to rollback and select a different version.
